# Deep-Learning-from-Scratch
1. Show how mathematical functions can be represented as a series of operations linked together to form a computational graph, and show how this representation lets us compute the derivatives of these functions’ outputs with respect to their inputs using the chain rule from calculus. [[Chapter 1. Foundations]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
2. Directly use the building blocks we created in Chapter 1 to build and train models to solve a real-world problem. [[Chapter 2. Fundamentals]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%202.%20Fundamentals.ipynb)
3. Take the building blocks from the first-principles-based approach of the first two chapters and use them to build the “higher level” components that make up all deep learning models: `Layers, Models, Optimizers, and so on`. [[Chapter 3. Deep Learning from Scratch]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
4. Cover the most important “training tricks” that generally increase the probability that a neural network will find a good solution, and, wherever possible, give some mathematical intuition as to why they work. [[Chapter 4. Extensions]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
5. Cover the fundamental ideas behind convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a kind of neural network architecture specialized for understanding images. [[Chapter 5. Convolutional Neural Networks]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
6. Throughout the first five chapters, we’ll build up a miniature neural network library that defines neural networks as a series of Layers—which are themselves made up of a series of Operations—that send inputs forward and gradients backward. [[Chapter 6. Recurrent Neural Networks]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
7. High performance with PyTorch. [[Chapter 7. PyTorch]](https://github.com/taufikfathurahman/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Chapter%201.%20Foundations.ipynb)
