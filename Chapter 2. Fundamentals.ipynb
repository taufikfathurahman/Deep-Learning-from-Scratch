    "In Chapter 1, I described th major conceptual building block for understanding deep learning: nasted continuous, differentiable functions. I showed how to represent these functions as computational graphs, with each node in a graph representating a single, simple function. In particular, I demonstrated that such a representation showed easily how to calculate the derivative of the output of the nasted function with respect to its input: we simply take the derivatives of all the constituent functions, evaluate these derivatives as the inputthat these functions recived, and then multiply all of the results together; this will result in a correct derivative for the nestedfunctions because of the chain rule. I illustrated tht this does in fact work with some simle examples, with functions that took `NumPy's ndarrays` as inputs and produced `ndarrays` as outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I showed that this method of computing derivatives works even when the function takes in multiple `ndarrays` as inputs and combines them via a *matrix multiplication* operation, which, unlike the other operations we saw, changes the shape of its inputs. Specifically, if one input to this operation—call the input $X$—is a `B × N ndarray`, and another input to this operation, $W$, is an `N × M ndarray`, then its output $P$ is a `B × M ndarray`. While it isn’t clear what the derivative of such an operation would be, I showed that when a matrix multiplication $ν(X, W)$ is included as a “constituent operation” in a nested function, we can still use a simple expression *in place of* its derivative to compute the derivatives of its inputs: specifically, the role of [Math Processing Error] can be filled by $X^T$, and the role of [Math Processing Error] can be played by $W^T$."
